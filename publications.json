        "summary": "This study introduces an innovative method to predict and analyze phase-locked modes in neural networks, focusing on master-slave systems with dynamic feedback. Expanding on traditional phase resetting, the research incorporates multiple inputs per cycle to better reflect complex neural interactions. The authors provide a recursive approach to calculate phase resetting for these scenarios, validated through numerical simulations. This framework offers new insights into neural synchronization, paving the way for advancements in understanding neural dynamics and their applications in neuroscience.",

        "summary": "This groundbreaking study explores how fine-tuning the local coordination environment of platinum (Pt) single atoms on cerium oxide (ceria) significantly enhances their catalytic performance for low-temperature carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation. By precisely adjusting the atomic arrangement around Pt atoms, researchers achieved improved catalytic activity and stability, paving the way for more efficient single-atom catalyst designs. These findings provide valuable insights for advancing catalytic technologies to address environmental challenges.",
