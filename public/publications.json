    "summary": "This paper investigates how coverage influences the adsorption and surface chemistry of N-methylaniline (NMA) on Pt(111). Combining DFT, TP-XPS, TPD, and FT-IRRAS, the study reveals that lower coverages lead to phenyl-ring binding and C–N bond activation, while higher coverages shift bonding to the nitrogen atom with different desorption behaviors. These insights deepen understanding of aromatic amine interactions on catalytic surfaces.",
