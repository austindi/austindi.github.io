            <h2>Education</h2>
<p>I earned my Ph.D. in Physics from the University of Central Florida (UCF) in August 2024. My doctoral research, under the guidance of Dr. Talat Rahman, focused on First Principles Studies of Nano-scale Phenomena at Surfaces: From Characteristics of Single Atom Catalysts to Molecular Structure Formation. Prior to this, I completed my M.S. in Physics at UCF in May 2022. I began my academic journey with a B.S. in Physics from the College of Charleston in May 2018.</p>
         </section>

         <section>

<h2>Research Experience</h2>
<p>During my time as a graduate research assistant at UCF from 2018 to 2024, I explored the theoretical underpinnings of surface phenomena, focusing on the unique electronic structures that emerge from the adsorption of atoms and molecules. My work included investigations into the physical and chemical properties of individually dispersed metal atom sites on oxide surfaces, with applications as cost-effective catalysts for critical chemical reactions. I also studied hybrid organic-inorganic interfaces to understand electron confinement and its implications for nanostructure engineering. Key projects involved elucidating water-gas shift reaction mechanisms, analyzing bi-stable molecular configurations, and uncovering a unique Kagome lattice pattern in molecular layers on Au(111). My research was generously supported by the National Science Foundation and supervised by Dr. Talat Rahman.</p>

<p>As an undergraduate research assistant at the College of Charleston (2017–2018), I developed computational models to study phase response curves for neurons and networks, leveraging numerical solvers for the Hodgkin-Huxley model to simulate connections among thousands of neurons. This work explored phase locking and resetting of neural firing patterns and introduced generalized methods for multi-stimuli phase resetting. This research, funded by an NSF Career Award Fellowship, was conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Sorinel Oprisan.</p>
         </section>

         <section>

<h2>Achievements</h2>
<p>My academic journey is marked by numerous accolades and contributions. I was honored as the UCF Physics Department Student of the Year (2022–2023) and received the AVS NSTD Graduate Student Award in 2024. I also earned the Resolv Cluster International Research Fellowship, enabling me to conduct research in Germany in 2023, and was nominated for the UCF Order of the Pegasus in 2024.

I have co-authored several peer-reviewed publications in journals such as Journal of Catalysis, ACS Nano, and Nature Communications. My published work spans topics including single-atom catalysts, molecular assembly on surfaces, and the electronic coupling at metal/organic interfaces. Additionally, I have delivered numerous oral and poster presentations at prestigious conferences, including the AVS International Symposium, the APS March Meeting, and the Gordon Research Conferences, showcasing my research findings to the scientific community.</p>

<h2>Mentoring and Tutoring</h2>
<p>I have a strong passion for mentoring and teaching, which has been evident throughout my academic career. I have mentored graduate students in research methodology, data analysis, and project execution, fostering their scientific and professional growth. Additionally, I guided high school students on science fair projects, sparking their interest in STEM fields. As part of my mentorship responsibilities, I held bi-weekly meetings with first-year Ph.D. students to help them navigate academic challenges and manage the stresses of graduate school.

As a teaching assistant at UCF, I led laboratory sessions for Introductory Physics, providing hands-on guidance to students and evaluating their performance. I also have extensive tutoring experience across various educational levels, ranging from middle school to graduate studies. Subjects I have tutored include mathematics (from algebra to advanced calculus and linear algebra), introductory and advanced physics, and other sciences such as chemistry and biology. My ability to simplify complex concepts has been instrumental in helping students excel academically.</p>

            <h2>Basketball: A Lifelong Love</h2>
            <p>I have been passionate about basketball since I was 12 years old. I played AAU basketball for the Spartanburg Bucks for five seasons and participated in local church leagues. In high school, I was a team manager for both varsity and JV basketball teams, as well as a member of the AV team, broadcasting games. I also played intramural basketball in college for three years and continue to play at my local gym.</p>

            <h2>Music: A Harmonious Journey</h2>
            <p>Music has been a cornerstone of my life. I played the cello from 5th to 12th grade and performed in my high school’s symphony orchestra. I joined the marching band in 11th grade, playing the xylophone and marimba in the pit, and moved to the drumline as a bass drummer in 12th grade. I also participated in the percussion ensemble, took piano lessons in college, and recently started drum lessons and self-teaching the guitar.</p>

            <h2>Billiards: Precision and Strategy</h2>
            <p>Since 2018, I’ve been passionate about billiards. As an APA member, I enjoy the challenge of strategy and precision in pool. Although I’m an amateur, billiards has become a fulfilling part of my life, offering both relaxation and competition.</p>
